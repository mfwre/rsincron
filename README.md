# rsincron
## About
This is a **very not ready** piece of software. I don't have an ETA yet since
`rsincron` will be worked on during my spare time.

## Description
`rsincron` aims to be a drop-in replacement of the, it seems, abandoned
`incron` projected. Feel free to message me for suggestions, critiques, hints
or contribution questions.

## Roadmap
- [ ] `rsincrontab`: `incrontab`'s sibling
- [ ] `rsincrond`: the daemon itself
