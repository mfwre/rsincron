# rsincron
## Description
`rsincron` aims to be a drop-in replacement of the, it seems, abandoned
`incron` projected. 

## Roadmap
- [ ] `rsincrontab`: `incrontab`'s sibling
- [ ] `rsincrond`: the daemon itself

## About
This is a **very not ready** piece of software. I don't have an ETA yet since
`rsincron` will be worked on during my spare time. Feel free to message me
for suggestions, critiques, hints or contribution questions.

Also, I neved had a public repository. If you want to share some experience
on how to maintain one feel welcome to do so.
